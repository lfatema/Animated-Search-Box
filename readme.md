# Calculator 

In this CSS-JavaScript project, we create a cool animated search bar. We have also added a close icon to close the search bar.
We also play around some minimal animation using css tranition.

We have added icons using google material icon. Please add the CDN link the head tag.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200" />
```

The project was developed by following the Online Tutorials youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jxqGQduWk&t=77s)


TIP: Whenever using google material icons, prefer to use the code point, this helps to reload the icon faster and avoids the textual content which is displayed during the page-loading in the place of icon.
